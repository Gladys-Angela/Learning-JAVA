    //Arithmetic Operartors
    //Java provides the following arithmetic operators for performing basic mathematical operations:

    int x = 10;
    int y = 3;

    //1. Addition 
    int sum = x+y;
    System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);

    //subtraction 
     int difference = x-y;
     System.out.println("The difference is " + difference);
     
     //3Multiplication
      int multiply = x * y;
      System.out.println("The multiply is " + multiply);

      //4. Division "/"
      int division = x / y;
      System.out.println("The division is " + division);
      //5 Modulus "%"(Returns the remainder)
      int modulus = y % x;
      System.out.println("The modulus is " + modulus);

    }
