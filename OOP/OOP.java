    //Object oriented programming - Beginner's guide 
    //Object oriented programming is one of the most important programming 
    //paradigms in modern software development. Let me walk you 
    //through each concept carefully, starting with the fundamentals


    // What is object oriented programming?
    //It is an approach to designing and building software that organizes code around data, or objects,
    // rather han functions and logic . It allows us to think  about programming in a way that resembles 
    //how we think about real world.

    //Think of it this way: the world is around us constists of objecsts(cars, books, people) that have 
    //certain properties and can perform ceratin actions. OOP brings this same intuitive structure into programming

    //Core concepts of OOPS
   // 1:Class and objects
   //CLASS: A class is like a blueprint or template that defies the properties (attributes) and behaviors(methods) 
   //that objects of that type will have.

   //2:OBJECT: An objects is an instance of a class. If a class is the blueprint for a house,
   // an object is an actual house builts from that blueprint

   //Let's look at a simple example:
   //Create a new file Dog - (Dog.java)

   //2. Encapsulation 
   //encapsulation means bundling the data (atributes)and the methods that 
   //operate on the data into a single unit(the class),
   // and restricting direct access to some of the objcets components

   //Think of encapsulation like a capsule or pill that keeps its contents protected inside.
   //The outside world doesn't need to know what's inside the pill or how it works.
   // It just needs to know what the pill does

   //Key aspects of encapsulation
   //1.Data Hiding: Making attributes private and only accessible through methods:
   //Access modifiers keywords that control the visibility of attributes and methods
   //protected: Accessible within the class
   //public = accessible from anywhere 
   //Default (no modifier) accessible within the same package

   //Lets see how we improve our Dog class with encapsulation: Improve
